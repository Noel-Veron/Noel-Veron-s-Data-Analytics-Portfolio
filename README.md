# Project 1: Supply Chain Data Analysis

During my internship at AI-Variant, I dove into Sales and Inventory data, turning numbers into clear insights with cool, interactive dashboards using Excel, Power BI, & Tableau.

* **Analytics Solutions Development:** Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including supply chain and
sales, to develop scalable analytics solutions using MySQL, Tableau, Excel, and Power BI, optimizing data for
visualization environments.

* **Data Access and Analysis:** Proficiently accessed and analyzed large-scale data, employing advanced Excel
techniques, pivot tables, and analytical skills to extract valuable insights, ensuring data accuracy and
reliability through MySQL.

* **Data Integration and Insights:** Merged diverse datasets through joins and views, providing structured
insights to enhance decision-making. Conducted cohort analysis for inventory and sales, uncovering a 25.23%
sales dip in 2023 due to 68% understocking.

* **Collaboration and Reporting:** Worked across teams, to deliver insightful reporting dashboards in Excel,
Tableau, & Power BI.

# Project 2: Air Crash Data Analysis

As an Aerospace Engineering graduate, I wanted to work on aircraft-related data and see what can I learn from it. In the process, I landed on a data set on Kaggle and I decided to work on it and create a compelling dashboard in Power BI.

* **Data Cleaning:** I cleaned the dataset by removing blank rows and eliminating unnecessary characters, ensuring a pristine foundation for analysis.
  
* **Data Integration:** To enhance the dataset's coherence, I merged a few columns, facilitating a more intuitive analysis process.
  
* **User-Friendly Interface:** I incorporated an easy Year slicer, which enables users to explore specific years and their corresponding analyses.
  
* **Effective Visualization:** Given the limited data details, I prioritized colour schemes, employing two distinct themes to enhance data visualization.
  
## Thoughts

To make this data analysis more fascinating, it would have been better if it included information about:
1. Timinning of the Take-off
2. Timinning of the crash
3. Climate conditions (Humidity levels, Wind speeds, Cloud Coverage, Fog/No Fog, Rain/No Rain, Snow/No Snow)
5. Altitude of the Flight
6. Speed of the Flight
7. Age of the aircraft

# Project 3: Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

In a recent data analysis project, I had the opportunity to delve into a Bank Marketing campaign that spanned over 10 months and reached out to more than 40,000 individuals through telephone and cellular modes of contact. The objective was clear: to assess the campaign's performance and provide insights to help the bank enhance its future direct marketing endeavours.

* **Targeting the Right Demographic:** The primary demographic engaged in the campaign consisted of working professionals aged 30 to 60 with strong educational backgrounds.
Remarkably, 79% of this demographic had no defaults on their existing loans, making them prime candidates for new term subscriptions. This low default risk is a valuable insight for future targeting strategies.

* **Optimizing Contact Methods:** The analysis revealed that a higher number of subscribers were acquired through cellular mode of contact.
It was evident that reaching out to customers with 1 to 5 calls was the sweet spot. Therefore, I recommended limiting the number of calls to a maximum of three for optimal results.

* **Consistency in Marketing Efforts:** An interesting finding was the importance of maintaining a consistent volume of calls each month. By targeting approximately 6,000 calls per month, primarily via cellular devices, and leveraging the current conversion rate of 8.877%, the bank could potentially sign up close to 5,700 subscribers for their new policy which is about 22% growth. This data-driven approach ensures a more predictable outcome.

* **Loan Types and Customer Loyalty:** I observed that customers with both personal and home loans showed lower interest in subscribing to a new policy. The analysis suggested that the bank should focus its efforts on audiences with either no loans or home loans for better campaign performance. Additionally, loyal and long-standing customers displayed a higher conversion rate for the new policy, emphasizing the importance of nurturing existing client relationships.

In conclusion, this data analysis not only sheds light on the performance of the Bank's Marketing campaign but also provides actionable insights for future strategies. By targeting the right demographic, optimizing contact methods, maintaining consistency, and focusing efforts on specific customer segments, the banking institution can significantly enhance the effectiveness of its direct marketing campaigns. These findings underscore the power of data analysis in driving informed decision-making and improving business outcomes.
