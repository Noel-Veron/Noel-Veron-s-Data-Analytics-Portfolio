# Project 1: Supply Chain Data Analysis

During my internship at AI-Variant, I dove into Sales and Inventory data, turning numbers into clear insights with cool, interactive dashboards using Excel, Power BI, & Tableau.

* **Analytics Solutions Development:** Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including supply chain and
sales, to develop scalable analytics solutions using MySQL, Tableau, Excel, and Power BI, optimizing data for
visualization environments.

* **Data Access and Analysis:** Proficiently accessed and analyzed large-scale data, employing advanced Excel
techniques, pivot tables, and analytical skills to extract valuable insights, ensuring data accuracy and
reliability through MySQL.

* **Data Integration and Insights:** Merged diverse datasets through joins and views, providing structured
insights to enhance decision-making. Conducted cohort analysis for inventory and sales, uncovering a 25.23%
sales dip in 2023 due to 68% understocking.

* **Collaboration and Reporting:** Worked across teams, to deliver insightful reporting dashboards in Excel,
Tableau, and Power BI.
