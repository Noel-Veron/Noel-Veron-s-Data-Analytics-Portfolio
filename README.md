# Project 1: Supply Chain Data Analysis

I interned at AI-Variant where I was tasked to analyse the Sales and Inventory data of a Supply Chain Unit.
I created insightful & interactive dashboards using the given data in Excel, Power BI & Tableau.

* **Analytics Solutions Development:** Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including supply chain and
sales, to develop scalable analytics solutions using MySQL, Tableau, Excel, and Power BI, optimizing data for
visualization environments.

* **Data Access and Analysis:** Proficiently accessed and analyzed large-scale data, employing advanced Excel
techniques, pivot tables, and analytical skills to extract valuable insights, ensuring data accuracy and
reliability through MySQL.

* **Data Integration and Insights:** Merged diverse datasets through joins and views, providing structured
insights to enhance decision-making. Conducted cohort analysis for inventory and sales, uncovering a 25.23%
sales dip in 2023 due to 68% understocking.

* **Collaboration and Reporting:** Worked across teams, to deliver insightful reporting dashboards in Excel,
Tableau, and Power BI.
