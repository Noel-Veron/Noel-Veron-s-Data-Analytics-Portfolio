# Project 1: Supply Chain Data Analysis

During my internship at AI-Variant, I dove into Sales and Inventory data, turning numbers into clear insights with cool, interactive dashboards using Excel, Power BI, & Tableau.

* **Analytics Solutions Development:** Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including supply chain and
sales, to develop scalable analytics solutions using MySQL, Tableau, Excel, and Power BI, optimizing data for
visualization environments.

* **Data Access and Analysis:** Proficiently accessed and analyzed large-scale data, employing advanced Excel
techniques, pivot tables, and analytical skills to extract valuable insights, ensuring data accuracy and
reliability through MySQL.

* **Data Integration and Insights:** Merged diverse datasets through joins and views, providing structured
insights to enhance decision-making. Conducted cohort analysis for inventory and sales, uncovering a 25.23%
sales dip in 2023 due to 68% understocking.

* **Collaboration and Reporting:** Worked across teams, to deliver insightful reporting dashboards in Excel,
Tableau, and Power BI.

# Project 2: Air Crash Data Analysis

As an Aerospace Engineering graduate, I wanted to work on aircraft-related data and see what can I learn from it. In the process, I landed on a data set on Kaggle and I decided to work on it and create a compelling dashboard in Power BI.

* Data Cleaning: I cleaned the dataset by removing blank rows and eliminating unnecessary characters, ensuring a pristine foundation for analysis.
* Data Integration: To enhance the dataset's coherence, I merged a few columns, facilitating a more intuitive analysis process.
* User-Friendly Interface: I incorporated an easy Year slicer, which enables users to explore specific years and their corresponding analyses.
* Effective Visualization: Given the limited data details, I prioritized colour schemes, employing two distinct themes to enhance data visualization.
  
## Thoughts

To make this data analysis more fascinating, it would have been better if it included information about:
1. Timinning of the Take-off
2. Timinning of the crash
3. Climate conditions (Humidity levels, Wind speeds, Cloud Coverage, Fog/No Fog, Rain/No Rain, Snow/No Snow)
5. Altitude of the Flight
6. Speed of the Flight
7. Age of the aircraft
